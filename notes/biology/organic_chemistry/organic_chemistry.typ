Newton: "We must learn from the phaenomena of nature what bodies attract one another, and what are the laws and properties of the attraction, before we enquire the cause"

Binding energies from various sources:
- *Coulombic* $alpha$ $q_1 q_2 \/ r$ Proton-Electron at 1.54 $angstrom$ ($216$ kcal/mol)
- *Magnetic* $alpha$ $mu_1 mu_2 \/ r^3$ Electron Spins at 1.54 $angstrom$ ($0.0014$ kcal/mol)
- *Gravitational* $alpha$ $m_1 m_2 \/ r$ C atoms at 1.54 $angstrom$ ($3 times 10^(-32)$ kcal/mol)
- *Chemical Bond* C atoms at 1.54 $angstrom$ ($90$ kcal/mol)
- *Strong Binding* Proton Neutron in Deuterium Nucleus ($5 times 10^7$ kcal/mol)
kcal/mol is the preferred unit of energy

Is there a chemical force law? How far could you stretch a chain of atoms before it snaps? If we were to use model of force that behaves as an inverse square law we have two minima, no stable molecules would be possible, if we were to use model that behaves as Hooke's law does then there are stable molecules but they are impossible to break. Morse potential is the mathematical formulation that allows for stable molecules at small distances that allows for breakage.

What are bonds? 19th century experiments led to *valence* numbers, why would they exist?. Electron was discovered in 1897, Lewis associated electrons with valences. A good theory should be realistic and simple (as possible), it should allow prediction, suggestion, explanation and classification. From the numebr of valence electrons we would like to predict: constitution (valence numbers for different atoms), structure (distances and angles), charge distribution, energy content, reactivity. Lewis could explain constitution (the nature and sequence of bonds). Equilibrium and resonance: resonance is when the true structure is in between the multiple Lewis predicted structures, its a failure of the model, equilibrium implies two possible structures separated by a double minimum. Resonance or equilibrium is true for a given molecule, must be figured out which is which by experimentation or by a better theory than Lewis'.
